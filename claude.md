## Game 1: Bomber

### Project Overview
Classic Bomber arcade game inspired by the VIC-20 version. Features two distinct game modes:
- **Bomber-1982**: Classic retro edition with traditional gameplay
- **Bomber-2025**: "Healing Harmony" satirical edition with modern parody elements

**Status**: âœ… Complete and deployed
**Repository**: `/bomber_game`

### Game Specifications

#### Core Gameplay
- **Objective**: Pilot a plane that automatically flies left-to-right across the screen, dropping bombs to destroy buildings below before crashing into them
- **Win Condition**: Successfully destroy all buildings to clear the level
- **Lose Condition**: Plane crashes into a building

#### Game Mechanics
1. **Plane Movement**:
   - Moves automatically from left to right at constant horizontal speed
   - Returns to left side after reaching right edge, dropping one altitude level
   - Cannot be controlled directionally by player
   - Speed increases slightly with each level

2. **Bombing Mechanics**:
   - Player drops bombs using spacebar (desktop) or tap (mobile)
   - Only one bomb can be active at a time
   - Bombs fall straight down with gravity
   - Bombs destroy 1-3 blocks randomly on impact (adds unpredictability)

3. **Buildings**:
   - Randomly generated heights (3-8 blocks tall)
   - Varied roof types (peaked, dome, flat)
   - Character-spaced bomb dropping (only at building centers)
   - Jagged destruction effects
   - 10% gaps between buildings

4. **Scoring**:
   - 10 points per building block destroyed
   - 100 bonus points for completing a level
   - Separate high scores for each game version

#### Version-Specific Features

**Bomber-1982 (Classic)**:
- Light blue sky background
- Black plane with animated propeller
- Red bombs with fins
- Tan buildings with windows
- Traditional UI and scoring
- Sound effects: whistling drops, white noise hits

**Bomber-2025 (Healing Harmony)**:
- Rainbow gradient pride sky
- Dark gray plane (optimized visibility)
- Pink heart-shaped "Equity Seeds"
- Gray buildings with satirical oppression labels
- Privilege checks every 30 seconds
- Affirmation messages on successful hits
- Emotional Labor & Carbon Offset counters
- Woke terminology throughout
- Sound effects: descending whistles, bloops, chimes

### Technical Implementation

#### Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  flame: ^1.10.0
  audioplayers: ^6.0.0
  shared_preferences: ^2.2.2
  window_manager: ^0.3.7
```

#### Key Components
- `BomberGame`: Main game class with version selection
- `Plane`: Animated plane component
- `Bomb`: Physics-based projectile with version-specific rendering
- `Building`: Destructible structures with jagged effects
- `Background`: Version-specific sky rendering
- `SoundManager`: Programmatic WAV generation for both versions
- `LevelManager`: Random level generation
- `ScoreManager`: Persistent high score tracking

#### Controls
- **1/2 Keys**: Select game version (1982 or 2025)
- **Space Bar**: Drop bomb / Start game / Confirm
- **P**: Pause/Unpause
- **ESC**: Return to version selection
- **Mouse Click**: Alternative to spacebar

## Suite-Wide Technical Requirements

### Flutter Setup
```yaml
# Common dependencies across games
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flame: ^1.10.0
  audioplayers: ^6.0.0
  shared_preferences: ^2.2.2
```

### Project Structure Pattern
```
retro/
â”œâ”€â”€ bomber_game/          # Completed
â”œâ”€â”€ yosser_game/          # Planned
â”œâ”€â”€ [future_game_3]/      # Future
â””â”€â”€ claude.md            # This file
```

### Performance Standards
1. **Frame Rate**: Target 60 FPS on all platforms
2. **Memory**: Efficient object pooling and resource management
3. **Loading**: Fast startup times (<3 seconds)
4. **Audio**: Low-latency sound effects (<50ms)

### Platform Support
- **Primary**: Linux (development and testing)
- **Secondary**: Android (deployment target)
- **Future**: Web, Windows, macOS

### Code Style Guidelines
- Follow Flutter's official style guide
- Maintain 80-character line limit where practical
- Document all public methods and classes
- Use meaningful variable names
- Implement proper error handling
- Consistent component architecture across games

### Common Features Across Games
1. **Version Selection**: Multiple game modes where applicable
2. **High Score Persistence**: Using shared_preferences
3. **Sound Management**: Programmatic audio generation
4. **Retro Aesthetics**: Authentic vintage game feel
5. **Modern Polish**: Smooth animations and responsive controls

### Build Instructions (All Games)

#### Linux Build
```bash
cd [game_directory]
flutter pub get
flutter build linux --release

## Development Workflow

### Adding a New Game
1. Create game directory: `/[game_name]_game/`
2. Initialize Flutter project structure
3. Set up Flame game engine
4. Implement core gameplay loop
5. Add audio system
6. Implement UI and menus
7. Add version selection if applicable
8. Test thoroughly on Linux
9. Deploy to Android
10. Update this documentation

### Code Reusability
- Share common managers (sound, score, level) where possible
- Create shared utilities library for cross-game functionality
- Maintain consistent component patterns
- Document reusable patterns for future games

### Version Control
- Each game in its own subdirectory
- Main branch contains stable releases
- Feature branches for development
- Comprehensive commit messages
- Regular cleanup of build artifacts

## Future Games (Ideas)
- Classic arcade shooters
- Puzzle games
- Platform games
- Racing games
- All maintaining retro aesthetic with modern features

## Notes
- Each game should be playable standalone
- Maintain authentic retro feel while adding modern quality-of-life features
- Consider dual-mode implementations (classic vs. modern) where satirically appropriate
- Prioritize performance and smooth gameplay
- Keep file sizes reasonable for mobile deployment
